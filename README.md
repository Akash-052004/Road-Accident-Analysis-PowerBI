# Road Safety Analysis Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard analyzes real-world road accident data to identify key trends, patterns, and contributing factors affecting road safety. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can inform strategic decision-making for accident prevention and mitigation.

## Data Source

The analysis is based on the provided `Road Accident Data.xlsx` dataset, containing various attributes related to road incidents.

## Key Features & Insights

This interactive dashboard is organized across three main pages, each focusing on different aspects of road safety:

### 1. Overview Page

* **Total Accidents & Casualties:** Displays the overall count of accidents and the resulting casualties.
* **Accident Severity Distribution:** Shows the proportion of slight, serious, and fatal accidents.
* **Accidents Over Time:** Visualizes monthly trends in accident occurrences.
* **Daily Accident Count:** Highlights accident frequency across different days of the week.
* **Date Slicer:** Allows dynamic filtering of all dashboard data by specific date ranges.

### 2. Environmental Conditions Page

* **Accident Severity by Weather Conditions:** Explores how different weather phenomena correlate with accident severity.
* **Accident Severity by Road Surface Conditions:** Analyzes the impact of road surface (e.g., dry, wet) on accident severity.
* **Accident Distribution by Light Conditions:** Presents the breakdown of accidents under varying lighting conditions.

### 3. Factors and Type Page

* **Top Junction Controls by Accidents:** Identifies specific types of road junctions contributing most to accidents.
* **Accident Distribution by Vehicle Type:** Shows the prevalence of different vehicle types involved in accidents.

## Tools Used

* **Microsoft Power BI Desktop:** For data cleaning, modeling, analysis, and visualization.

## How to View the Dashboard

1.  **Download:** Download the `Road Safety Dashboard.pbix` file from this repository.
2.  **Install Power BI Desktop:** Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed on your computer. You can download it for free from the Microsoft website.
3.  **Open:** Open the downloaded `.pbix` file directly with Power BI Desktop.

## Project Files

* `Road Safety Dashboard.pbix` - The main Power BI dashboard file.
* `Road Accident Analysis Summary.pdf` - A detailed summary document outlining the analysis approach, key findings, and derived insights.

## Insights from the Analysis

* **Targeted Interventions for High-Risk Factors:** The analysis revealed that accidents are most frequent on **weekdays/Fridays** and at **'Give way or uncontrolled' junctions**. While cars are the most involved vehicle type, understanding the specific accident profiles of motorcycles and vans is also crucial.
* **Addressing Environmental Condition Risks:** Although the majority of accidents occur in 'fine' weather and on 'dry' roads, **adverse conditions (e.g., 'snowing', 'wet or damp' surfaces)**, though less frequent, warrant attention for their potential impact on accident severity.
* **Importance of Data Quality:** The presence of 'Data missing or out of range' values for key attributes like 'Junction Control' affects the completeness of analysis, highlighting areas for improved data collection.
